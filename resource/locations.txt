squareRoom:The way that this room seems to shrink as you go further is unsettling. The door at the far end of the room is locked, but I bet I could barely fit through. There are a couple of cabinets sitting on the side wall. One could be opened, you suppose. Maybe there's something inside? There are a few pots and pans lining the walls. Nothing of note. How can I get through this door? There's a rather weak-looking lock on the door...
forestZone:The sun peeks through the treeline, showing the mossy undergrowth of the forest. At least everything here seems to be settled and calm. You peer through the trunks of the large leafy trees, and you think you spot something. A small chest. Sitting on the chest is a soldier who's body is a large playing card. You step closer and a twig snaps underfoot. The soldier awakens suddenly with a snort, and stares right at you.
rabbitsHouseLivingRoom:The old house has an air of dread. The dark windows, barely illuminated by candlelight. The door is open. You open it slowly, the entryway door creaking quietly. Comfortable, yet well-used furniture is scattered throughout the dusky living room. A hallway lies at the south end of the living room. The doorway to the square room sits at the north end of the living room.
rabbitsHouseHallway:The hallway is so incredibly dark... there are only two doorways, to the living room on the north end of the hallway, and the southern exit towards what appears to be a back room...
rabbitsHouseBackroom:The back room of the home is more of a large lean-to with screen walls... It appears to be an outdoor lounging area. It hasn't been used for a while, given the amount of vegetative growth on the lawn chairs and table. In the eastern corner is a pile of hay... Looks flammable. That could be dangerous!
