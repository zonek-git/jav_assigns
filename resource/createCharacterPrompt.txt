** Welcome. Please create your custom mercenary.

** In your first typed response in the box below, enter your mercenary's name.
** After pressing enter to confirm, then type in the numerical value of your three choices below.

** Your choice will give you an attribute boost, but to only one of the characteristics. Make your choice wisely.

** 1 - Charisma: You'll have an enhanced ability to potentially run away from combat, or to convince your enemy to
** willingly give you the items and/or information you're searching for. Some information will be impossible to gain
** without this attribute, but there are select enemies that will be IMPOSSIBLE to convince.

** 2 - Fortitude: The Rabbit's Hole is dark and frightening. Something always seems to lurk around every corner. In
** dark areas, you will lose sanity the longer you remain in that location. By selecting this attribute boost, you'll
** be able to more thoroughly search the darkened areas without losing as much Sanity as you normally would. Every turn
** in a darkened area will reduce your sanity by a certain percentage.

** 3 - Combat Ability: This ability allows you to boost your overall combat performance. It will increase the odds of a
** critical hit, regardless of the object/item you're using to fight.

** Please input your name:
