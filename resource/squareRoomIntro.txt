You had no idea how long you fell, but you knew the landing hurt.

Glancing upwards, bracing yourself against a nearby wall, you see a long narrow path. The geometry of the room was obscure,
mangled and confusing to your eyes. Removing your compass, the hallway moved to the north.

The walls of this "vestibule" had been decorated with two small cabinets, and a red chest. Along the opposing wall,
hung a potted plant that contains a Red Rose. You felt it calling to you.

Grabbing the rose, watching as the red color drains from its petals and wilts, you suddenly feel more invigorated.
