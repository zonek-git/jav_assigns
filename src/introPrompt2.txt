While dark out, you were still able to trace the muddy footprints of the teenager. The moon seemed closer to
the Earth around this time of year, it was working in your favor. You tumbled down a steep incline,
using your trusty baton to catch yourself from falling into the stream at the bottom.

Margaret trusted you to be able to find her sister, Alice.

Muddy footprints were clearly visible under the bright moonlight, illuminating a series of smooth stones lining the river.

Following the trail, you came upon a small opening in the ground underneath a tree. White fabric was caught on a tree branch
near the hole. Clearly, the young teenager had decided to go inside.

You enter the Rabbit Hole. Suddenly, the earth gives away under your feet.

A scream of panic could be heard coming from the forest.

You dropped your baton on the ground nearby. The room you were in...

You'd describe it as a room full of square tiles... The square room. The way that this room seems to shrink as you go
further is unsettling. The door at the far end of the room is locked, but I bet I could barely fit through. There are a
couple of cabinets sitting on the side wall. One could be opened, you suppose. Maybe there's something inside? There
are a few pots and pans lining the walls. Nothing of note. How can I get through this door? There's a rather weak-looking
lock on the door to the south...

It appears there are some items in this room as well:
Rose
Padlock
Cabinet
Baton

There doesn't seem to be anyone else in here with you...
