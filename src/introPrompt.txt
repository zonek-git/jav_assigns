Margaret was worried.

She could feel the sweat pooling in her clenched palms. Glancing at her father's old clock, the only thing that survived
the fire that had taken the life of her parents, Margaret rolled her eyes as she realized she'd waited a whole 12 seconds
since she last checked the time. The hands on the clock almost mocking her; her sister Alice was incredibly late.

Although she had the tendency to mindlessly wander through the forest without a care in the world, Alice was always timely.
It was beginning to play games with Margaret's mind. The last surviving members of her immediate family since the fire,
Margaret had taken to being Alice's caretaker. She had a responsibility to make sure she was safe and cared for.

Her earlier attempt at searching for her dear sister proved fruitless, she couldn't find her anywhere. She needed to find
her. She had to hire a professional. Grasping at her tea cup tightly, she drained the remaining contents and swiftly
moved towards the door of the small home. She had an old mercenary friend she could trust to find Alice.
